# tab2desktop extension for chrome browser

With this extension you can open websites in your chrome desktop browser from chrome mobile browser.  

# how to use
* install plugin
* open bookmark manager
* create new folder somewhere (e.g. in "other bookmarks", so it will not appear on bookmarks bar)
* open extension options and select your newly created bookmark folder

This extension will track selected bookmark folder and as soon as there will be new bookmark, it will be open in new tab.

I tested my extension with chrome android so far, but it actually should work with chrome browser on any other OS. 
You could even send tabs from one desktop to another and make each chrome desktop track another bookmarks folder.
